# Day-Planner

Created a day planner that changes color based on the time

I first you jquery to save the text information to the local storage

I then made a function for each save button to save each idividual text so that when you reload the page it would have you day plan saved for you.

I then made three functions for each text field so that they would change color depending on the time
Grey for past, green for future, and red for the current time as the readme for the homework sugjested.
